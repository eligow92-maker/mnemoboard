# ProdReady Design Skill

References to slash commands mean use the corresponding `prodready-*` skill.


Design HOW the application will work. This phase defines architecture, tech stack, and API contracts.

**Estimated time**: ~15 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Complete `prodready-define` and pass `prodready-gate define`

## Instructions

Read the define phase artifacts and design the technical architecture.

### Prerequisites Check

1. Verify `.prodready/define/` exists with:
   - vision.md
   - constitution.md
   - constraints.md
   - requirements/user-stories.md
   - data-model/schema.* (any schema file)
   - prd.md

   Read `prd.md` first for a quick project overview, then dive into specific artifacts as needed.

2. Create design directory:
   ```
   .prodready/design/
   ├── architecture/
   │   └── adr/
   ├── api/
   └── ui/ (if frontend)
   ```

---

## Step 0.5: Challenge Assumptions Before Designing

Before presenting architecture options, probe the user's understanding of their own constraints:

- "What's more important for v1.0: shipping fast or managing complexity long-term?"
- "How do you expect traffic to grow — gradually or in spikes?"
- "What's your team's strongest technical skill — is the stack leveraging that?"

These questions often reveal that constraints from Define have shifted or were aspirational rather than real.

**Max 2-3 questions. Move on after one round of answers.**

---

## Step 1: Select Architecture Pattern

Based on constraints and scale requirements, recommend an architecture pattern.

### Analysis

Read from `.prodready/define/constraints.md`:
- Deployment target
- Scale expectations
- Team size

### Pattern Options

Present options with trade-offs:

| Pattern | Best For | Trade-offs |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Monolith** | MVP, small team, fast iteration | Scaling limits, coupled deployment |
| **Modular Monolith** | Medium complexity, future split | More upfront structure |
| **Microservices** | Large team, high scale | Complexity, ops overhead |
| **Serverless** | Variable traffic, low ops | Cold starts, vendor lock-in |

Ask user to confirm or choose pattern, then generate:

`.prodready/design/architecture/pattern.md`:

```markdown
# Architecture Pattern

## Selected Pattern: [Pattern Name]

## Rationale
Based on:
- Deployment: [from constraints]
- Scale: [from constraints]
- Team: [from constraints]

[Pattern] was selected because:
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]

## Structure

```
[ASCII or description of architecture]
```

## Key Decisions
- [Decision 1]
- [Decision 2]

## Future Considerations
- [If/when to change pattern]
```

---

## Step 2: Define Tech Stack

### Read Stack Preferences

First, read `.prodready/define/constraints.md` → "Tech Stack Preferences" section.

- If the user specified preferences → use those as the starting point, validate against project needs, and fill in any gaps
- If "to be decided" → recommend based on constraints (deployment, scale, team, budget)
- In either case, present the full stack for user confirmation before generating

**Probe tech stack preferences:**
If the user specified a stack, don't just accept it — ask ONE question:
> "Why [framework/database]? What specific problem does it solve for THIS project, vs being your default choice?"

If the answer is "I know it well" — that's valid. If "it's just what everyone uses" — present the trade-off with an alternative that better fits the constraints.

### Generate Tech Stack Document

`.prodready/design/architecture/tech-stack.md`:

```markdown
# Tech Stack

## Core

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Language | [from constraints or recommended] | [rationale] |
| Runtime | [appropriate runtime] | [rationale] |
| Framework | [from constraints or recommended] | [rationale] |
| Database | [from constraints or recommended] | [rationale] |
| ORM | [from constraints or recommended, or "none"] | [rationale] |

## Infrastructure

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Container | Docker | Portability, consistency |
| Reverse Proxy | [Traefik/Nginx/Caddy] | SSL, routing |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | Integration, free tier |

## Development

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [Linter for chosen language] | Linting |
| [Formatter for chosen language] | Formatting |
| [Unit test framework] | Unit/Integration testing |
| [E2E test framework] | E2E testing |
| [Git hooks tool] | Git hooks |

## Versions

[JSON block with actual chosen versions]

## Authentication

- Strategy: [JWT/Session/OAuth]
- Library: [appropriate for framework]
- Storage: [Cookie/LocalStorage details]

## Monitoring (Optional)

>
> | Layer | Technology | Rationale |
> |-------|------------|-----------|
> | Language | TypeScript | Type safety, ecosystem |
> | Runtime | Node.js 20 LTS | Stability, support |
> | Framework | Next.js 15 | App Router, RSC, API routes |
> | Database | PostgreSQL | Relational, robust, free |
> | ORM | Prisma | Type-safe, migrations |
>

## Step 3: Create ADRs

For significant architectural decisions, create Architecture Decision Records.

### Required ADRs

Generate at least these ADRs:

1. **ADR-001: Framework Selection**
2. **ADR-002: Database Choice**
3. **ADR-003: Authentication Strategy**

### ADR Template

`.prodready/design/architecture/adr/ADR-001-framework-selection.md`:

```markdown
# ADR-001: Framework Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Date
[Current date]

## Context
[Why this decision was needed]

## Decision
We will use [Framework] because:
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]

## Consequences

### Positive
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]

### Negative
- [Trade-off 1]
- [Trade-off 2]

### Risks
- [Risk and mitigation]

## Alternatives Considered
1. [Alternative 1]: Rejected because [reason]
2. [Alternative 2]: Rejected because [reason]
```

---

## Step 4: Generate OpenAPI Specification

Based on user stories, generate API contract.

### Process

1. Read user stories from `.prodready/define/requirements/user-stories.md`
2. Read data model from `.prodready/define/data-model/schema.*` (Prisma, SQL, or other schema file)
3. Generate RESTful API endpoints

### Generate OpenAPI

`.prodready/design/api/openapi.yaml`:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0

  title: [Project Name] API
  version: 1.0.0

## Step 5: UI Design (If Frontend)

If the project includes a frontend, create basic design tokens and wireframes.

### Design Tokens

`.prodready/design/ui/tokens.md`:

```markdown
# Design Tokens

## Colors

### Brand
- primary: #3B82F6
- primary-dark: #2563EB
- secondary: #10B981

### Semantic

- warning: #F59E0B
- error: #EF4444
- info: #3B82F6

### Neutral
- background: #FFFFFF
- surface: #F9FAFB
- text-primary: #111827
- text-secondary: #6B7280
- border: #E5E7EB

## Typography

- font-family: Inter, system-ui, sans-serif
- font-size-xs: 0.75rem
- font-size-sm: 0.875rem
- font-size-base: 1rem
- font-size-lg: 1.125rem
- font-size-xl: 1.25rem
- font-size-2xl: 1.5rem

## Spacing

- spacing-1: 0.25rem
- spacing-2: 0.5rem

- shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)
- shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)
```

### Component List

`.prodready/design/ui/components.md`:

```markdown
# UI Components

## Primitives
- [ ] Button (primary, secondary, ghost, danger)
- [ ] Input (text, email, password)
- [ ] Select
- [ ] Checkbox
- [ ] Radio

## Composite
- [ ] Form
- [ ] Card
- [ ] Modal
- [ ] Toast
- [ ] Table

## Layout
- [ ] Header
- [ ] Sidebar
- [ ] Footer
- [ ] Container
```

---

## Step 6: Socratic Design Review

Before declaring the phase complete, stress-test the design against the Define artifacts. First interrogate the artifacts yourself; only take genuinely open questions to the user.

**Self-checks (answer from artifacts, fix silently if you can):**

- **Story → API coverage**: for each P0 user story, name the endpoint(s) in `openapi.yaml` that implement it. A P0 story with no endpoint is a defect — add the endpoint or flag it.
- **ADR honesty**: does each ADR list a real alternative with a real rejection reason? "Alternative: none" or circular reasons ("rejected because we chose X") → rewrite.
- **AuthN vs AuthZ**: the spec defines who can log in — does anything define who can do *what*? If stories imply roles/ownership, the design must say where authorization lives.
- **Constraint compliance**: does the stack/pattern contradict budget, deployment target, or a non-negotiable from `constitution.md`?

**Questions for the user (max 3, only if artifacts can't answer):**

- "What would have to be true in 6 months for [chosen pattern] to be the wrong choice? Is that plausible given your growth expectations?"
- "The first bottleneck at [scale from constraints] will likely be [X]. Address it now or consciously defer it?"
- "When [external service/dependency] is down, what should the user see?"

Record the answers: update the relevant ADR (add to Risks/Consequences) or `pattern.md` — don't let them evaporate into chat history.
